# Object-oriented-charting-dashboard-UML
* The main aim of this project is to model, design, and implement an object oriented charting Dashboard for data analytics and visualization of 
datasets in Demographics. 
* The dashboard is modeled and designed using UML, and implemented using Javascript, and tested on Firefox, compliant with ECMAScript 2015 and ES6.
* The dashboard GUI provides the following capabilities:
	1. The ability to select a dataset from a list of datasets in certain category.
	2. Datasets to be read from a data file in CSV or JSON format.
	3. The ability to view the selected dataset as a table in the browser (Firefox).
	4. The users ability to graph/plot the data on the dashboard in multiple chart types including Line, Bar, Pie, Stacked, Pivot.
	5. The users ability to select/deselect columns for inclusion/exclusion of data from the dataset.
	6. The users ability to filter rows for inclusion/exclusion of the data for charting the selected data.
	7. The users ability to plot/chart basic stat data, such as min, max, average, count, standard deviation, etc.
* Charts are implemented using Chart.js object.
* Tabular display achieved using Dataframe.js object.
